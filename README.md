# Stockpile
A simple Android application for inventory.
*This project is a work-in-progress.*

## Goals
Stockpile is designed to be simple and intuitive, with as shallow a learning curve as possible.  It aims to be serviceable in a professional warehouse, but be 
simple enough for tracking household items.  This application simply tracks how many of a given item are on hand and where they are.

## Features
Stockpile employs a many-to-many relationship between items and locations, enabling users to store and track items across multiple locations and/or store multiple items per location.
Interfaces make extensive use of iconography, making it intuitive and easily localizable.

## Requirements
Android API level 22 (5.1, Lollipop) or above.
